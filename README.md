# GDAT 515: Final Project
### Statement of Work
Using data finance.yahoo.com, I would like to create an application which depicts how each of the thirty companies listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) have performed in the past year. Ideally, there will be a level of interactivity which allows the user to select a particular stock, and be able to view a scatterplot regarding its open, high, low, or close price.

### Problem Statement
Investors want to be informed about the index funds/companies they are investing in. By creating this application, the user will be able to get a better idea of how each of the stocks in The Dow are performing currently, and how they have performed in the past. This information will help guide investors to a comfortable decision.

### Technical Objectives
Environment: RStudio

Data Sources: finance.yahoo.com
